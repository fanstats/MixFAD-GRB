Latent characterisation of the BATSE Gamma Ray Bursts catalogue using
Gaussian Mixture of Factor Analysers and Model-estimated Overlap-Based
Syncytial Clustering
================

This project applies the Gaussian mixture of factor analyzers (MixFAD)
and the Model-estimated Overlap-Based Syncytial Clustering (MOBSynC) to
cluster and characterize the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from the Burst and
Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) 4Br Catalog.

The following figures display the densities and scatter plots for the
1599 BATSE Catalog GRBs ($\log_{10}$ transformed), and the densities and
scatter plots that show the properties of the GRB clusters in terms of
three composite features, duration ($T_{90}$), total fluence
($F_1 + F_2 + F_3 +F_4$) and spectral hardness
($H_{321} = F_3/(F_1 +F_2$)).
